# Compound III

## Introduction

Compound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the *base asset*. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol.

The initial deployment of Compound III is on Ethereum and the base asset is USDC.

The [app.compound.finance](https://app.compound.finance) interface is [open-source](https://github.com/compound-finance/palisade), deployed to IPFS, and is maintained by the community.

Please join the #development room in the Compound community [Discord](https://compound.finance/discord) server as well as the forums at [comp.xyz](https://comp.xyz); Compound Labs and members of the community look forward to helping you build an application on top of Compound III. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.

For documentation of the Compound v2 Protocol, see [compound.finance/docs](https://compound.finance/docs).

## Interest Rates

Users with a positive balance of the base asset earn interest, denominated in the base asset, based on a supply rate model; users with a negative balance pay interest based on a borrow rate model. These are separate interest rate models, and set by governance.

The supply and borrow interest rates are a function of the utilization rate of the base asset. Each model includes a utilization rate "kink" - above this point the interest rate increases more rapidly. Interest accrues every second using the block timestamp.

Collateral assets do not earn or pay interest.

### Get Supply Rate

This function returns the per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by `10 ^ 18`. The formula for producing the supply rate is:

```
## If the Utilization is less than or equal to the Kink parameter

SupplyRate = (InterestRateBase + InterestRateSlopeLow * Utilization) * Utilization * (1 - ReserveRate)

## Else

SupplyRate = (InterestRateBase + InterestRateSlopeLow * Kink + InterestRateSlopeHigh * (Utilization - Kink)) * Utilization * (1 - ReserveRate)
```

To calculate the Compound III supply APR as a percentage, pass the current utilization to this function, and divide the result by `10 ^ 18` and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in one year and scale up by 100.

```
Seconds Per Year = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
Utilization = getUtilization()
Supply Rate = getSupplyRate(Utilization)
Supply APR = Supply Rate / (10 ^ 18) * Seconds Per Year * 100
```

#### Comet

```solidity
function getSupplyRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)
```

* `utilization`: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.
* `RETURNS`: The per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by `10 ^ 18`. E.g. `317100000` indicates, roughly, a 1% APR.

### Get Borrow Rate

This function returns the per second borrow rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by `10 ^ 18`. The formula for producing the borrow rate is:

```
## If the Utilization is less than or equal to the Kink parameter

BorrowRate = InterestRateBase + InterestRateSlopeLow * Utilization

## Else

BorrowRate = InterestRateBase + InterestRateSlopeLow * Kink + InterestRateSlopeHigh * (Utilization - Kink)
```

To calculate the Compound III borrow APR as a percentage, pass the current utilization to this function, and divide the result by `10 ^ 18` and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in one year and scale up by 100.

```
Seconds Per Year = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
Utilization = getUtilization()
Borrow Rate = getBorrowRate(Utilization)
Borrow APR = Borrow Rate / (10 ^ 18) * Seconds Per Year * 100
```

#### Comet

```solidity
function getBorrowRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)
```

* `utilization`: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.
* `RETURNS`: The per second borrow rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by `10 ^ 18`. E.g. `317100000` indicates, roughly, a 1% APR.

### Get Utilization

This function returns the current protocol utilization of the base asset. The formula for producing the utilization is:

`Utilization = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply`

#### Comet

```solidity
function getUtilization() public view returns (uint)
```

* `RETURNS`: The current protocol utilization percentage as a decimal, represented by an unsigned integer, scaled up by `10 ^ 18`. E.g. `1e17 or 100000000000000000` is 10% utilization.

## Collateral & Borrowing

Users can add collateral assets to their account using the *[supply](#supply)* function. Collateral can only be added if the market is below its *[supplyCap](#get-asset-info-by-address)*, which limits the protocol's risk exposure to collateral assets.

Each collateral asset increases the user's borrowing capacity, based on the asset's *[borrowCollateralFactor](#get-asset-info-by-address)*. The borrowing collateral factors are percentages that represent the portion of collateral value that can be borrowed.

For instance, if the borrow collateral factor for WBTC is 85%, an account can borrow up to 85% of the USD value of its supplied WBTC in the base asset. Collateral factors can be fetched using the *[Get Asset Info By Address](#get-asset-info-by-address)* function.

The base asset can be borrowed using the *[withdraw](#withdraw)* function; the resulting borrow balance must meet the borrowing collateral factor requirements. If a borrowing account subsequently fails to meet the borrow collateral factor requirements, it cannot borrow additional assets until it supplies more collateral, or reduces its borrow balance using the supply function.

Account *balances* for the base token are signed integers. An account balance greater than zero indicates the base asset is supplied and a balance less than zero indicates the base asset is borrowed. *Note: Base token balances for assets with 18 decimals will start to overflow at a value of 2<sup>103</sup>/1e18=~10 trillion.*

Global *indices* for supply and borrow are unsigned integers that increase over time. When an account interacts with the protocol, the indices are saved. An account's present balance can be calculated using the current index with the following formulas that implement the indices.

```
Balance=PrincipalBaseSupplyIndexNow [Principal0]
Balance=PrincipalBaseBorrowIndexNow [Principal<0]
```

### Supply

The supply function transfers an asset to the protocol and adds it to the account's balance. This function can be used to **supply collateral, supply the base asset, or repay an open borrow** of the base asset.

If the base asset is supplied resulting in the account having a balance greater than zero, the base asset earns interest based on the current supply rate. Collateral assets that are supplied do not earn interest.

There are three separate methods to supply an asset to Compound III. The first is on behalf of the caller, the second is to a separate account, and the third is for a manager on behalf of an account.

Before supplying an asset to Compound III, the caller must first execute the asset's ERC-20 approve of the Comet contract.

#### Comet

```solidity
function supply(address asset, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function supplyTo(address dst, address asset, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function supplyFrom(address from, address dst, address asset, uint amount)
```

* `asset`: The address of the asset's smart contract.
* `amount`: The amount of the asset to supply to Compound III expressed as an integer. A value of `MaxUint256` will repay all of the `dst`'s base borrow balance.
* `dst`: The address that is credited with the supplied asset within the protocol.
* `from`: The address to supply from. This account must first use the Allow method in order to allow the sender to transfer its tokens prior to calling Supply.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

### Withdraw

The withdraw method is used to **withdraw collateral** that is not currently supporting an open borrow. Withdraw is **also used to borrow the base asset** from the protocol if the account has supplied sufficient collateral. It can also be called from an allowed manager address.

Compound III implements a minimum borrow position size which can be found as `baseBorrowMin` in the [protocol configuration](#get-protocol-configuration). A withdraw transaction to borrow that results in the account's borrow size being less than the `baseBorrowMin` will revert.

#### Comet

```solidity
function withdraw(address asset, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function withdrawTo(address to, address asset, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function withdrawFrom(address src, address to, address asset, uint amount)
```

* `asset`: The address of the asset that is being withdrawn or borrowed in the transaction.
* `amount`: The amount of the asset to withdraw or borrow. A value of `MaxUint256` will withdraw all of the `src`'s base balance.
* `to`: The address to send the withdrawn or borrowed asset.
* `src`: The address of the account to withdraw or borrow on behalf of. The `withdrawFrom` method can only be called by an allowed manager.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

### Collateral Balance

This function returns the current balance of a collateral asset for a specified account in the protocol.

#### Comet

```solidity
function collateralBalanceOf(address account, address asset) external view returns (uint128)
```

* `account`: The address of the account in which to retrieve a collateral balance.
* `asset`: The address of the collateral asset smart contract.

### Borrow Collateralization

This function returns true if the account passed to it has non-negative liquidity based on the borrow collateral factors. This function returns false if an account does not have sufficient liquidity to increase its borrow position. A return value of false does not necessarily imply that the account is presently liquidatable (see *[isLiquidatable](#liquidatable-accounts)* function).

#### Comet

```solidity
function isBorrowCollateralized(address account) public view returns (bool)
```

* `account`: The account to examine collateralization.
* `RETURNS`: Returns true if the account has enough liquidity for borrowing.

<p>

```js
const comet = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abiJson, provider);
const isCollateralized = await comet.callStatic.isBorrowCollateralized('0xAccount');
```

</p>
</details>

## Liquidation

Liquidation is determined by *[liquidation collateral factors](#get-asset-info-by-address)*, which are separate and higher than borrow collateral factors (used to determine initial borrowing capacity), which protects borrowers & the protocol by ensuring a price buffer for all new positions. These also enable governance to reduce borrow collateral factors without triggering the liquidation of existing positions.

When an account's borrow balance exceeds the limits set by liquidation collateral factors, it is eligible for liquidation. A liquidator (a bot, contract, or user) can call the *[absorb](#absorb)* function, which relinquishes ownership of the accounts collateral, and returns the value of the collateral, minus a penalty (*[liquidationFactor](#get-asset-info-by-address)*), to the user in the base asset. The liquidated user has no remaining debt, and typically, will have an excess (interest earning) balance of the base asset.

Each absorption is paid for by the protocol's reserves of the base asset. In return, the protocol receives the collateral assets. If the remaining reserves are less than a governance-set *[target](#target-reserves)*, liquidators are able to *[buy](#buy-collateral)* the collateral at a *[discount](#ask-price)* using the base asset, which increases the protocol's base asset reserves.

### Liquidatable Accounts

This function returns true if the account passed to it has negative liquidity based on the liquidation collateral factor. A return value of true indicates that the account is presently liquidatable.

#### Comet

```solidity
function isLiquidatable(address account) public view returns (bool)
```

* `account`: The account to examine liquidatability.
* `RETURNS`: Returns true if the account is presently able to be liquidated.

### Absorb

This function can be called by any address to liquidate an underwater account. It transfers the account's debt to the protocol account, decreases cash reserves to repay the account's borrows, and adds the collateral to the protocol's own balance. The caller has the amount of gas spent noted. In the future, they could be compensated via governance.

#### Comet

```solidity
function absorb(address absorber, address[] calldata accounts)
```

* `absorber`:  The account that is issued liquidator points during successful execution.
* `accounts`:  An array of underwater accounts that are to be liquidated.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

```

</p>
</details>

### Buy Collateral

This function allows any account to buy collateral from the protocol, at a discount from the Price Feed's price, using base tokens. A minimum collateral amount should be specified to indicate the maximum slippage acceptable for the buyer.

This function can be used after an account has been liquidated and there is collateral available to be purchased. Doing so increases protocol reserves. The amount of collateral available can be found by calling the *[Collateral Balance](#collateral-balance)* function. The price of the collateral can be determined by using the *[quoteCollateral](#ask-price)* function.

#### Comet

```solidity
function buyCollateral(address asset, uint minAmount, uint baseAmount, address recipient) external
```

* `asset`: The address of the collateral asset.
* `minAmount`: The minimum amount of collateral tokens that are to be received by the buyer, scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the collateral asset's contract.
* `baseAmount`: The amount of base tokens used to buy collateral scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the base asset's contract.
* `recipient`: The address that receives the purchased collateral.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

```

</p>
</details>

### Ask Price

In order to repay the borrows of absorbed accounts, the protocol needs to sell the seized collateral. The *Ask Price* is the price of the asset to be sold at a discount (configured by governance). This function uses the price returned by the protocol's price feed. The discount of the asset is derived from the `StoreFrontPriceFactor` and the asset's `LiquidationFactor` using the following formula.

```
DiscountFactor = StoreFrontPriceFactor * (1e18 - Asset.LiquidationFactor)
```

#### Comet

```solidity
function quoteCollateral(address asset, uint baseAmount) public view returns (uint)
```

* `address`:  The address of the asset which is being queried.
* `amount`:  The amount of the asset to be sold.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

### Liquidator Points

The protocol keeps track of the successful executions of absorb by tallying liquidator "points" and gas the liquidator has spent.

#### Comet

```solidity
mapping(address => LiquidatorPoints) public liquidatorPoints;
```

* `address`:  The address of the liquidator account.
* `RETURN`: A struct containing the stored data pertaining to the liquidator account.
* `numAbsorbs`: A Solidity `uint32` of the number of times absorb was successfully called.
* `numAbsorbed`: A Solidity `uint64` of the number of accounts successfully absorbed by the protocol as a result of the liquidators call to the absorb function.
* `approxSpend`: A Solidity `uint128` of the sum of all gas spent by the liquidator that has called the absorb function.

## Reserves

Reserves are a portion of historical interest set aside as cash which can be withdrawn or transferred through the protocol's governance. A portion of borrower interest accrues into the protocol, determined by the reserve factor. The Compound III account [liquidation](#liquidation) process uses and also adds to protocol reserves.

There is an immutable value in the Comet contract that represents a target reserve value. Once the contract has reached the level of target reserves, liquidators are not able to buy collateral from the protocol.

### Get Reserves

This function returns the amount of protocol reserves for the base asset as an integer.

#### Comet

```solidity
function getReserves() public view returns (int)
```

* `RETURNS`: The amount of base asset stored as reserves in the protocol as an unsigned integer scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the asset's contract.

### Target Reserves

This immutable value represents the target amount of reserves of the base token. If the protocol holds greater than or equal to this amount of reserves, the *[buyCollateral](#buy-collateral)* function can no longer be successfully called.

#### Comet

```solidity
function targetReserves() public view returns (uint)
```

* `RETURN`: The target reserve value of the base asset as an integer, scaled up by 10 to the "decimals" integer in the base asset's contract.

## Protocol Rewards

Compound III has a built-in system for tracking rewards for accounts that use the protocol. The full history of accrual of rewards are tracked for suppliers and borrowers of the base asset. The rewards can be any ERC-20 token. In order for rewards to accrue to Compound III accounts, the configuration's `baseMinForRewards` threshold for total supply of the base asset must be met.

### Reward Accrual Tracking

The reward accrual is tracked in the Comet contract and rewards can be claimed by users from an external Comet Rewards contract. Rewards are accounted for with up to 6 decimals of precision.

#### Comet

```solidity
function baseTrackingAccrued(address account) external view returns (uint64);
```

* `RETURNS`: Returns the amount of reward token accrued based on usage of the base asset within the protocol for the specified account, scaled up by `10 ^ 6`.

### Claim Rewards

Any account can claim rewards for a specific account. Account owners and managers can also claim rewards to a specific address. The claim functions are available on the external Comet Rewards contract.

#### Comet Rewards

```solidity
function claim(address comet, address src, bool shouldAccrue) external
```

```solidity
function claimTo(address comet, address src, address to, bool shouldAccrue) external
```

* `comet`: The address of the Comet contract.
* `src`: The account in which to claim rewards.
* `to`: The account in which to transfer the claimed rewards.
* `shouldAccrue`: If true, the protocol will account for the rewards owed to the account as of the current block before transferring.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

## Account Management

In addition to self-management, Compound III accounts can enable other addresses to have write permissions for their account. Account managers can withdraw or transfer collateral within the protocol on behalf of another account. This is possible only after an account has enabled permissions by using the *[allow](#allow)* function.

### Allow

Allow or disallow another address to withdraw or transfer on behalf of the sender's address.

#### Comet

```solidity
function allow(address manager, bool isAllowed)
```

* `msg.sender`: The address of an account to allow or disallow a manager for.
* `manager`: The address of an account that becomes or will no longer be the manager of the owner.
* `isAllowed`: True to add the manager and false to remove the manager.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

### Allow By Signature

This is a separate version of the allow function that enables submission using an EIP-712 offline signature. For more details on how to create an offline signature, review [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712).

#### Comet

### Account Permissions

This function returns a boolean that indicates the status of an account's management address.

#### Comet

```solidity
function hasPermission(address owner, address manager) public view returns (bool)
```

* `owner`: The address of an account that can be managed by another.
* `manager`: The address of the account that can have manager permissions over another.
* `RETURNS`: Returns true if the `manager` address is presently a manager of the `owner` address.

### Transfer

This function is used to transfer an asset within the protocol to another address. A manager of an account is also able to perform a transfer on behalf of the account. Account balances change but the asset does not leave the protocol contract. The transfer will fail if it would make the account liquidatable.

There are two variants of the transfer function: `transfer` and `transferAsset`. The former conforms to the ERC-20 standard and transfers the base asset, while the latter requires specifying a specific asset to transfer.

#### Comet

```solidity
function transfer(address dst, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function transferAsset(address dst, address asset, uint amount)
```

```solidity
function transferAssetFrom(address src, address dst, address asset, uint amount)
```

* `dst`: The address of an account that is the receiver in the transaction.
* `src`: The address of an account that is the sender of the asset in the transaction. This transfer method can only be called by an allowed manager.
* `asset`: The ERC-20 address of the asset that is being sent in the transaction.
* `amount`: The amount of the asset to transfer. A value of `MaxUint256` will transfer all of the `src`'s base balance.
* `RETURN`: No return, reverts on error.

### Interfaces & ERC-20 Compatibility

The Comet contract is a fully compatible ERC-20 wrapper for the base token. All of the interface methods of ERC-20 are externally exposed for accounts that supply or borrow. The **CometInterface.sol** contract file contains an example of a Solidity interface for the Comet contract.

## Helper Functions

## Bulk Actions

The Compound III codebase contains the source code of an external contract called *Bulker* that is designed to allow multiple Comet functions to be called in a single transaction.

Use cases of the Bulker contract include but are not limited to:
  * Supplying of a collateral asset and borrowing of the base asset.
  * Supplying or withdrawing of the native EVM token (like Ether) directly.
  * Transferring or withdrawing of the base asset without leaving dust in the account.

### Invoke

#### Bulker

```solidity
uint public constant ACTION_SUPPLY_ASSET = 1;
uint public constant ACTION_SUPPLY_ETH = 2;
uint public constant ACTION_TRANSFER_ASSET = 3;
uint public constant ACTION_WITHDRAW_ASSET = 4;
uint public constant ACTION_WITHDRAW_ETH = 5;

## Governance

Compound III is a decentralized protocol that is governed by holders and delegates of COMP. Governance allows the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative smart contract functions of the Compound III protocol. For more information on the Governor and Timelock see the original [governance](https://compound.finance/docs/governance) section.

All instances of Compound III are controlled by the Timelock contract which is the same administrator of the Compound v2 protocol. The governance system has control over each *proxy*, the *Configurator implementation*, the *Comet factory*, and the *Comet implementation*.

Each time an immutable parameter is set via governance proposal, a new Comet implementation must be deployed by the Comet factory. If the proposal is approved by the community, the proxy will point to the new implementation upon execution.

To set specific protocol parameters in a proposal, the Timelock must call all of the relevant set methods on the *Configurator* contract, followed by `deployAndUpgradeTo` on the *CometProxyAdmin* contract.
