// TODO: Relations are needed when:
// 1. Multiple assets (USDC, WETH, etc.) are deployed on BDAG-Primordial and share infrastructure
// 2. Bridge contracts, governance contracts, or other shared components need to be tracked
// 3. Cross-asset dependencies exist (e.g., if WETH deployment needs to reference existing USDC bridge contracts)
// 4. You want to avoid redeploying shared contracts across different asset deployments
// 5. You need to use the Spider system to automatically discover and track contract relationships
// 
// IMPORTANT: If you add relations here, you MUST also declare them in hardhat.config.ts:
// - Import this file at the top: import bdagPrimordialUsdcRelationConfigMap from './deployments/bdag-primordial/usdc/relations';
// - Add to deploymentManager.networks: 'bdag-primordial': { usdc: bdagPrimordialUsdcRelationConfigMap }
// 
// For now, this file is empty because we're only deploying a single asset (USDC).
// Add relation mappings here when additional assets are deployed that share infrastructure.
