# BDAG Primordial Deployment - Custom .gitignore
# 
# Since BDAG Primordial doesn't have an explorer API yet, we need to commit
# the .contracts/ cache to preserve contract addresses and metadata for the team.
# This overrides the global .gitignore that typically excludes cache files.

# Allow all cache files and deployment artifacts for BDAG Primordial
